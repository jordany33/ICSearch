For the queries that did bad, a majority of the issues were long query times and at time some irrelavant results, both of which were mainly
due to either a large number of stop words in the query, or how common the queries were. To address these issues, we added the option to use 
champion lists in our search instead of the full index. We tested champion lists of different sizes and found the best results when using 
champion lists of roughly 1-2.5 thousand postings per term max. This drastically reduced the search time of our queries while also not really 
affecting the results in comparison to the full index. Additionally, we also filtered out stop words if the query itself didn’t appear to have 
that many of them (not important to the query), this prevented us from wasting time accessing stop words that may not contribute much to the query 
results, while still checking them for queries that relied on them.
